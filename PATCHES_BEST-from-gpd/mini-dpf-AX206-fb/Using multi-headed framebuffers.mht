ou
				started with running a dual head configuration
				of Linux.  While this process is pretty
				straight forward there are numerous things that
				one can do wrong along the way.</p><p>The example I concentrate on is g=
etting an
				X-server running on a second monitor.  I find
				this nice as you can usually find old large 19&quot;
				to 21&quot; fixed frequency monitors around that
				people are giving away because they can&#x27;t use
				them.  This way you can boot off a small
				multisync and then use X on a nice big
				monitor.</p><p>Please understand dual head support is currently
				developing so this information changes rapidly.
				Anything in this document could be out of date
				or just plain incorrect by the time you are
				reading this.</p><p>** WARNING ** This document was written before

"><a name=3D"AEN1078"></a>11.9. Getting Started</h2><p>The first thing you&=
#x27;ll need to do is to patch a
				copy of the Linux source with the
				&quot;fbaddon&quot; patch.  Then you need to
				configure the kernel and turn on frame buffer
				support.  If you have Matrox cards turn on
				Matrox unified accelerated driver support as
				well as the particular type of card you have.
				Don&#x27;t turn on VESA frame buffer support. It can
				cause a conflict.  Do turn on multi-head
				support (obviously). Build the kernel and
				reboot.</p><p>Now you need to install the &quot;fbset&quot;
				program and carefully read all the
				documentation on how to adjust the settings.
				Using a &quot;/etc/fb.modes&quot; file is
				highly recommended once you&#x27;ve decided on your
				settings.  The fbset program includes a Perl
				script to convert your XF86Config file to
				fb.modes settings.  I&#x27;ve included my
				octave/Borne shell script to convert your
				XF86Config file in Appendix A &amp; B.</p><p>You need to get comfortabl=
e with using the frame
				buffer device on one monitor, understanding any
				issues that can arise from your set up that
				have nothing to do with multi-head support.
				This can save a lot of head scratching
				later.</p><p>I&#x27;m going to concentrate my explanation on
				getting X running on the second monitor as
				doing most other configurations will just be a
				obvious subset of the procedure.</p><div class=3D"section"><h3 class=3D=
"section"><a name=3D"AEN1087"></a>11.9.1. Move a console over...</h3><p>Com=
pile the &quot;con2fb&quot; program.  If you run
					it without any arguments you&#x27;ll get the
					following usage message: &quot;usage:
						con2fb fbdev
						console&quot;.</p><p>Thus, an example command would be
					&quot;con2fb /dev/fb1
						/dev/tty6&quot; to move
					virtual console number six over to the
					second monitor.  Use Ctrl-Alt-F6 to
					move over to that console and see that
					it does indeed show up on the second
					monitor.</p></div><div class=3D"section"><h3 class=3D"section"><a name=
=3D"AEN1093"></a>11.9.2. Use &quot;&quot; to adjust the
					settings on this second display</h3><p>Only set the &quot;fbset&quot;
					settings on the monitor you run the
					&quot;fbset&quot; command on.
					Therefore, you must be careful to use
					the &quot;-fb&quot; flag on the
					second monitor.  In particular, if you
					do nothing else you&#x27;ll probably want to
					at least set the virtual vertical
					resolution to your actually vertical
					resolution.</p><p>e.g. &quot;fbset -fb /dev/fb1 -vyres
						600&quot;</p><p>This will seriously slow down text mode,
					but X will be obnoxious without
					it.</p></div><div class=3D"section"><h3 class=3D"section"><a name=3D"A=

r.txt file explains this
					better than I can, but here&#x27;s the two
					important points.</p><p>Make sure you set the link for &quot;X&quot; to
					point to &quot;XF86_FBDev&quot;.</p><p>Next you need to add a monitor =
section to
					your XF86Config file for the frame
					buffer device.  Here&#x27;s an example:</p><p></p><p class=3D"literall=

ction"><a name=3D"AEN1124"></a>11.10. Summary</h2><p>The steps involved in =
getting a X server running
				on a second display can be summrized as
				follows:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>Get the kernel patch,
						fbset and
						con2fb</p></li><li><p>Patch the kerenl, configure,
						rebuild and
						reboot</p></li><li><p>Add XF86_FBDev
						section to XF86Config file and
						set X symbolic
						link</p></li></ul><p>Then each time you reboot:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>=
Move a console over e.g.
						&quot;con2fb /dev/fb1
							/dev/tty6&quot;</p></li><li><p>Adjust the settings e.g.
						&quot;fbset -fb /dev/fb1
							1280x1024&quot;</p></li><li><p>Set the FRAMEBUFFER e.g. &quot;export=
 FRAMEBUFFER=3D/dev/fb1&quot;</p></li><li><p>Start the X server e.g. &quot;=
startx -- -bpp 16 vt06&quot;</p></li></ul><p>You can automate this each tim=
e you reboot via a
				shell alias.  It must be an alias and not a
				shell script since it needs to detect the
				current console number.  This is my csh alias
				to start up X on a second fixed frequency
				monitor:</p><p></p><p class=3D"literallayout">
alias startxfb =3D &quot;
setenv FRAMEBUFFER /dev/fb\!*;    # Set the env var to the cmd arg.
con2fb $FRAMEBUFFER /dev/$tty;    # Move the fb to the current tty.
fbset -fb $FRAMEBUFFER 1280x1024@62;  # Favorite from /etc/fb.modes
startx -- :\!* -bpp 16 vt0`echo $tty | cut -dy f 2`&#x27; # X on this tty.
&quot;
			</p><p></p><p>In my .cshrc file these are all on the same line
				together without the comments, but it&#x27;s easier
				to read here with line breaks and comments
				inserted.  I just give the number of the frame
				buffer as an argument and it starts right
				up.</p><p>I&#x27;m not sure how to do this same alias in bash.
				I don&#x27;t know how to determine the current tty
				or get the arguments to an alias in bash.  If
				someone lets me know I&#x27;ll insert it here.
				However, you can use the &quot;tty&quot; command to get
				the name of the current VT and just make two
				separate aliases for each X server.</p></div><div class=3D"section"><h2=
 class=3D"section"><a name=3D"AEN1157"></a>11.11. Other Notes and Problems<=
/h2><p></p><ul><li><p>Both &quot;fbset&quot; and
						&quot;startx&quot; commands
						MUST be run from the same frame
						buffer as the one being
						affected.  This places serious
						limits on how much of these
						commands can be automated via
						scripts.</p></li><li><p>XFree86 4.0 will have &quot;proper&quot;
						multi-head support, but 3.3.1
						does not.  You can run two
						servers with 3.3.1 and use
						&quot;x2x&quot; to switch
						between them
						however...(see the next
						bullet)</p></li><li><p>The inactive frame buffer will
						just hold the last image of
						when it was active, no updates
						with occur.</p></li><li><p>The monitor that&#x27;s not selected
						doesn&#x27;t always preseve it&#x27;s
						state when not active. (But it
						usually does)</p></li><li><p>Geert Uytterhoeven (the frame
						buffer maintainer) and Linus
						Torvalds don&#x27;t agree with the
						current &quot;frame buffer per VT&quot;
						multi-head console support
						changes (i.e.
						&quot;fbaddon&quot;) so it
						may never be in the mainstream
						kernel tree. (This was heard
						third hand and may be wildly
						untrue.)</p></li><li><p>If you &quot;break the rules&quot; and
						start the X server (run
						&quot;startx&quot;) from a
						different monitor, the machine
						can eventually crash badly with
						the keyboard and mouse input
						all mixed
						together.</p></li><li><p>The documentation
						framebuffer.txt in the kernel
						source explains that you can
						use the Modeline settings in
						your XF86Config file directly
						when running X.  Using the
						Matrox frame buffer seems to
						force the X server to drop all
						of those.  So you can only have
						the one
						(&quot;default&quot;)
						setting at at time (the same
						one you had in text
						mode).</p></li><li><p>The XF86_FBDev driver is
						unaccelerated. However, there
						are patches for accelerated
						Matrox support at <a href=3D"http://www.in-berlin.de/User/kraxel/xfre=
