SECOND UPDATE: Jan 25th: readded cpu optimizations for alota cpu's and added the kali-wifi-injection patches.
	removed watchdog from rt2800usb (ralink)

UPDATE: Jan 25th: updated to 4.14.15 still testing sum mwifiex. brcmfmac, ath9k patches b4 commiting

SECOND UPDATE: JAN 17TH: fixed issue with atheros when booting with wireless disabled. 4.14.14/w patches seems to
	fine. Just added debugfs entry for selecting channel width (thanks openwrt) recompiling now to test. FYI
	the debugfs 5=5 10=10 default=default yup confusing;)

UPDATE: JAN 17TH: Linux 4.14.14 added the official retpoline patches, but the gcc toolchains have yet to be put
	into any repos that i know of. For now use the toolchain on my github ill check later today for any newer
	versions.Im currently compiling the 4.14.14 with all patches. If it compiles and works fine ill update github
	today.I ran tests with everything on 4.14.13. digital photo frame framebuffer for tiny DPF's work great. The
	usb	modules from android work great too. Only problem I found was if running usb_f_fs usb_f_mtp usb_f_ptp
	with mtp server by itself has major issues. Everything from large amount of files being displayed to hitting
	back in file explorer would freeze it. But combining with ACM and net it seems to work fine. Atheros with
	CTL disabled works fine unless you disable wireless with network manager and reboot with wireless still
	disabled the kernels freaks and hates life. So yeah don't do that. Other then that all seems to work fine.

ï»¿UPDATE: JAN 14TH: Just added the not yet mainlined retpoline patches to help mitigate the spectre vulnerability.
	It requires a patched gcc which is also not commited yet so use the one in my repo for now.
	https://github.com/bm16ton/gcc-retpoline
	Ill be able to remove these patches as soon as the finished code is mainlined

UPDATE: Jan 11th 2018: Brought to 4.14.13 which has patches for "Meltdown" just enable CONFIG_PAGE_TABLE_ISOLATION
	in your kernel config. UNFORTUNATELY Spectre doesn't appear to have patches in mainline kernel yet. Tho I have
	read sum distros have implemented there own out of tree patches. I will hopefully find time to look into
	those and maybe use them until an official mainline fix is out.

UPDATE: Jan 8th 2018: Added new xboxdrv userland driver in tools/16ton, patched with support for wireless chatpad
	(from https://github.com/xboxdrv/xboxdrv/tree/8a0b802bfcbc8ae48d803ea61d60ff6b2ddc42c7) plus my own
	minor patches/changes for dpkg-buildpackage to work

UPDATE: Jan 5th 2018: new usb-ACM-mtp-setup script in tools/16ton/mtp_adb this should work on OTG ports.
	That said thanks to the work of HansGeode we have automatic port host/client switching, if you dont
	may need to adjust accordingly.
	MTP ttyACM and Mass storage WORK! just compile the required modules in. Use config-newest_use_this
	"cp config-newest_use_this .config"  then compile and install "make deb-pkg" sudo dpkg -i ../*.deb"
	"sudo cp tools/16ton/mtp_adb/usb-ACM-mtp-setup /usr/local/sbin"      reboot
    "sudo usb-ACM-mtp-setup"  then plug usb into PC.

UPDATE Jan 4th 2018; added two more pairs of dev/prod ids to uss720 (belkin F5UOO2 and D-Link DSB-P36)
	Added Android usb gadget/configfs/function  USB_F_FS USB_F_MTP USB_F_PTP USB_CONFIGFS_UEVENT
	also function_accessory but its currently in a dependency cycle and i haven't looked at it.
	So far only mtp is tested (on gpd-win but should work with other otg devices) and works good
	as far as i can tell. in tools/16ton you will find a heavily patched mtp-server which is hard coded
	to share /root and no longer has the android/unity dependencies.
	Ubuntu's repo version of adbd would segfault (same as mtp-server) and a diff one is on tools, it
	doesn't segfault and the host machine can see it, haven't gotten beyond that yet.
	The script in tools/16ton usb-mtp-setup run as root then start mtp-server as root

	In tools/16ton/parport is program called pport which allows you to use parport and serial
	ports as GPIO. Even works with usb to parallel with uss720 chipsets. Ill add schematic sometime
	to show how to wire transistors and relays to control bigger things.

UPDATE Dec 27 2017; brought up to 4.14.9
	nvidia 384 doesn't compile against 4.14.9, patches to fix this in CURRENTLY_APPLIED_PATCHES
	directory out-of-tree now has the following out of tree kernel modules (I believe they all have dkms support)
			i2c-ch341-usb    kernel i2c driver for ch341a
			spi-ch341-usb	 kernel spi driver for ch341a
			xtables-addons   iptables addons

UPDATE Dec 22 2017; Brought up to 4.14.8
