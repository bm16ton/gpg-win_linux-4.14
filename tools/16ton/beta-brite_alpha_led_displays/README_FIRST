These are my basic scripts to control Beta-brite and by extension alpha led signs.
Its untested on Alpha signs tho, I only have the one beta-brite. All my scripts use
/dev/ttyUSB0 pls change to suite. I will note this most if not all docs say to run
stty commands on the port prior to use. On all my ubuntu 16.04 this would cause an
exact 2minute delay before transmitting ANY data EVERY time over the uart. Without
setting these options with stty it always worked just fine so I ignored it.
