xboxdrv failed to compile on Ubuntu 18.04 missing X11-dev headers, it was a problem
with scons, I git cloned the repo upstream source, altho the versions where identical
the git version had a fix, so I changed the version to like -16ton or someshit, so
synaptic etc wouldnt replace it. the scons folder is the required working source
