So with kernel patches all 5ghz channels are now completely open but the txpower is listed for each channel as much lower
then the crda rules say.

With reghack the channels are completely open and list txpower as the same as the crda rules but in practice they still
wont go to the higher txpower values, THAT SAID ITS STILL HIGHER THEN THE KERNEL PATCHES ALLOW

IE
	KERNEL PATCHES
5ghz channel 56
ch 56 lists txpower as 15dBm but i could only get it to 14dBm

	REGHACK
5ghz channel 56
ch 56 lists txpower as 33dBm but i could only get it to 20dBm
